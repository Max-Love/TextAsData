This can be seen clearly in countries such as China today, where their rapid economic development has resulted in an equally rapid deterioration in air and water quality. As a result, many people assume that there is an inherent trade-off, and that some environmental quality must be sacrificed for the sake of economic development.

Protests in China are unlikely to have major influence on the regime’s stability in short and near term.

Xi has secured unlimited power and eliminated political rivals, but emerging public dissatisfaction challenges the regime and forces Chinese authorities to strengthen the security apparatus.

Norway,2019,ECA,CHINA,"NATO has implemented major reforms since 2014, and is one of few multilateral organisations that is more capable of fulfilling its duties now than just a few years ago. Shifting power relations that affect NATO are primarily Russia’s growing ability and willingness to use military force, and to some degree, the shifting US-China power rela­tions. Russia’s use of force in breach of interna­tional law has undermined security in Europe and cooperation in the OSCE, the Council of Europe and the NATO-Russia Council. However, it has also made NATO more relevant, and created stronger ties among member states and greater willingness to prioritise collective defence and deterrence. This is playing out at the same time as the US is strengthening its military presence in Europe.

USA,1950,NA,CHINA,"Several conclusions seem to emerge. First, the Soviet Union is widening the gap between its preparedness for war and the unpreparedness of the free world for war. It is devoting a far greater proportion of its resources to military purposes than are the free nations and, in significant components of military power, a greater absolute quantity of resources. Second, the Communist success in China, taken with the politico-economic situation in the rest of South and South-East Asia, provides a springboard for a further incursion in this troubled area. Although Communist China faces serious economic problems which may impose some strains on the Soviet economy, it is probable that the social and economic problems faced by the free nations in this area present more than offsetting opportunities for Communist expansion. Third, the Soviet Union holds positions in Europe which, if it maneuvers skillfully, could be used to do great damage to the Western European economy and to the maintenance of the Western orientation of certain countries, particularly Germany and Austria. Fourth, despite (and in part because of) the Titoist defection, the Soviet Union has accelerated its efforts to integrate satellite economy with its own and to increase the degree of autarchy within the areas under its control.

India,2019,SA,CHINA," The rise of nationalism in politics is being witnessed across the world and is reflected in election results in diverse countries. These include major powers such as the US, Russia, France, and China. The nationalist sentiment is geared to prevent a perceived erosion of national identity and is strongest in homogenous societies. However, nationalism in pluralistic societies has also become an important political factor, which often uses economic issues for political purposes. There is an inherent confrontation between the policy of insulation and protectionism, spearheaded by nationalism, and the policy of integration and expansion, represented by globalisation. 
Each period in history comes with its unique set of challenges. We have attempted to suggest solutions to the security risks that India faces today. We do not seek to dissect history and dig into past missteps. We look to the future to see how it could be shaped to build a safer and more prosperous India.

These include international trade wars such as the US-China trade dispute; geopolitical realignments such as BREXIT; evolution of extra-territorial financial instruments such as crypto-currencies; development of new technologies and energy sources; and lastly global commodity price instability. For instance, crude oil remains our major source of revenue but is susceptible to the volatility of the international market. The events in recent times that resulted in global slump in oil price impacted directly on our economy and country. Therefore, our national economic security strategy needs to factor in these external economic and trade events that impact low income countries such as Nigeria.

Brunei,2021,EAP,CHINA,"26. Maritime. Despite efforts to maintain stability through collective measures and activity, security in the maritime domain continues to be placed at increasing risk. Tensions arise from a combination of threats which include but are not limited to: maritime terrorism, piracy, unlawful intrusions into territorial waters, illegal fishing, and the trafficking of drugs, weapons and humans. Illegal, unreported, unregulated (IUU) fishing activities threaten as a worrying catalyst for maritime conflict in the region. Not only do these activities impose significant economic costs on countries that face exploitation, but they also have the ability to heighten tensions between states, becoming politicised, fractious and unpredictable. Port infrastructure and commercial shipping are also increasingly vulnerable to regional piracy and maritime terrorism. The maintenance of essential SLOC for all nations in the South East Asia region is fundamental to the security and prosperity of each state. Threats posed to lines of communication and infrastructure, present significant economic disruption to all nations. Tensions related to overlapping maritime claims in the South China Sea have increased, as nations seek to dominate and influence in the region. Militarisation of maritime features will continue to be of grave concern as the reach of nations expand well beyond their own mainland shorelines and recognised Economic Exclusive Zones (EEZs). This risk of miscalculation and the ensuing spiralling of regional instability is potentially the most significant threat in the maritime domain. Left unchecked, the situation will only worsen. A sophisticated combination of collective and individual actions from nations will be required to maintain stability in the maritime domain. In the first instance, efforts must be made to define accepted norms and behaviours in accordance with international law (namely UN Convention on the Law of the Sea, UNCLOS). Beyond this, it will be necessary for nations to build more effective and integrated maritime security capabilities, blended with those of all other operating domains, to ensure the integrity of the oceans and seas. Additionally, efforts should be enhanced to ensure full and effective implementation of the 2002 Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea (DOC) in its entirety, as well as, ensuring substantive progress is made in the negotiations towards an early conclusion of an effective and substantive Code of Conduct in the South China Sea (COC) consistent with international law, including the 1982 UNCLOS.

However, uncertainties impeding peace and development are also on the increase. The world is far from being tranquil. The old international political and economic order, which is unfair and irrational, has yet to be changed fundamentally. Economic development of the world is materially unbalanced, and the North-South gap is further widening. The developing countries have gained less from the economic globalization process, and some of them are in danger of being marginalized. Democracy in international relations remains elusive, and there are new manifestations of hegemonism and power politics. In certain regions, disputes caused by ethnic, religious, territorial, resources or other issues crop up from time to time, leading even to armed conflicts and local wars.

It is believed that the development of relations with India can be attributed to their intent to place importance on economic growth as well as their responses to progressing U.S.–India relations.

Argentina,2015,LAC,RUSSIA," There are many variables that account for the current international scenario. Its structural features come from the characteristics adopted by the international system after the end of the Cold War and the irruption of the United States of America, a country that through various devices and resources of hard and soft power has projected itself as a dominant global power. Its ability to project forces and influence on a global scale, thanks to the deployment of hundreds of bases selectively located in various geographical enclaves of strategic interest, is the best example of this. However, in recent decades there has been a slow decline of that power –together with that of the European system– and the emergence of new state actors with the capacity to influence the international agenda. The aspirations of these emerging powers, among which Brazil, China, India and Russia stand out, give a new dynamic to the contemporary international system, which thus exhibits a trend of redistribution of global power.

Russia has also interfered brazenly in U.S. politics and worked to sow divisions among the American people. And Russia’s destabilizing actions are not limited to the international arena.

The accompanying CFE Final Act reflects a number of important political commitments, including agreements on the complete withdrawal of Russian armed forces from Moldova and partial withdrawal of Russian forces from Georgia.

India,2019,SA,RUSSIA," The rise of nationalism in politics is being witnessed across the world and is reflected in election results in diverse countries. These include major powers such as the US, Russia, France, and China. The nationalist sentiment is geared to prevent a perceived erosion of national identity and is strongest in homogenous societies. However, nationalism in pluralistic societies has also become an important political factor, which often uses economic issues for political purposes. There is an inherent confrontation between the policy of insulation and protectionism, spearheaded by nationalism, and the policy of integration and expansion, represented by globalisation. 
Each period in history comes with its unique set of challenges. We have attempted to suggest solutions to the security risks that India faces today. We do not seek to dissect history and dig into past missteps. We look to the future to see how it could be shaped to build a safer and more prosperous India.

The reduction of military personnel is coming to an end and no further large-scale reduction is planned for the future77. In structural reforms, shift to three services and three independent corps78 and the integration of military districts have been almost completed. As for the modernization of military forces, President Putin approved the state policy on military equipment for the period from 2007 to 2015 and accordingly, approximately five trillion rubles will be spent in the development and procurement of military equipment by 2015. At the same time, efforts are being made to create an integrated order placement system. On the other hand, in order to improve the quality of military personnel and maintain highly skilled forces, Russia is implementing measures toward the introduction of a contract-based service, under which soldiers are recruited not by conscription but by contract79. Together with the ongoing improvement of the permanent combat-ready troops, the contract-based service would contribute to the improvement of the Russian military combat readiness. Also, Russia has been improving the military unit command system, and Russia is thought to continue these measures to improve conventional armed forces along with its efforts to maintain nuclear deterrent potential against the backdrop of the national defense budget that has been increasing in recent years80.

From the first day it gained nuclear weapons, China has solemnly undertaken not to be the first to use nuclear weapons at any time and in any circumstance and unconditionally not to use or threaten to use nuclear weapons against non-nuclear­weapon states or nuclear-weapon-free zones. China as a nuclear-weapon state never shies away from its due obligations, advocating that nuclear-weapon states should undertake not to be the first to use nuclear weapons and repeatedly proposing that nuclear-weapon states negotiate and conclude an international treaty on the no-first-use of nuclear weapons against each other. In January 1994, China formally presented a draft for the Treaty on the No-First-Use of Nuclear Weapons to the United States, Russia, Britain, France and other countries, proposing that the five nuclear-weapon states hold first-round discussions on the treaty in Beijing as soon as possible. On April 5, 1995, China made another official statement, reiterating its unconditional provision of ""negative security assurance"" to all non-nuclear-weapon states, at the same time undertaking to provide these nations with ""positive security assurance.""

This is unlikely to happen; China is now the world’s largest carbon emitter, and its emissions are still rising. Recent assessments indicate that China’s carbon emissions will not peak until 2030-2040, or perhaps 2050. The particular significance of this is that on business-as-usual growth projections, China will by then be emitting almost as much carbon (equivalent) as the USA, India and the EU combined. This is why the world temperature rise is now likely to be at least 4°C.

The enlargement of the EU will further strengthen our ties with Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland. The conditions for meeting common threats and challenges in our immediate vicinity will improve when all the countries around the Baltic Sea participate in shaping the European Union’s common policy, in close partnership with Russia. This will be a great step towards realising the peace, security and economic development implicit in the idea of European integration. Sweden’s security too will be enhanced as a result. 
The introductory chapter presents a summary of the Defence Commission’s views on international developments and the conclusions for Sweden’s security policy that the Commission draws from them. In chapter 2 there follows an overview of global trends and tendencies that are relevant to the security policy assessment. Chapter 3 provides a description of security-building endeavours pursued by multinational cooperation in various organisations at global and regional level. Security and defence policy cooperation and events in the immediate vicinity are discussed in chapter 4. The enlargement of the EU and NATO, the development of a common security and defence policy dimension in the EU, and the changes in the tasks assigned to NATO are described in chapter 5. Chapters 6 and 7 give an account of developments in the United States and Russia respectively, taking up the influence of the terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001 on American society and policy, and Russia’s work on the reform of its armed forces, among other issues. A number of questions associated with weapons of mass destruction, arms control and the development of missile defence systems are discussed in chapter 8. Chapter 9 provides a survey of current conflicts and centres of conflict, followed by an examination of international crisis management and conflict prevention efforts in chapter 10. Chapter 11 describes the vulnerability of civil society and the relations of dependence that arise from the use of modern technology and access to a working infrastructure.

France,2008,ECA,EU,"France considers the security of the Mediterranean basin and that of Europe to be intimately linked. This position is expressed first and foremost within the framework of the European Union. The EU possesses appropriate financial and institutional mechanisms to provide the basis for abalanced relationship with its immediate neigh­bours through partnerships linking economic, cultural, political, and security issues. This approach, an essential component of prevention, is founded on principles of transparency and balance with the objective of building long-term relations. It takes concrete form in the inclusion in co­operation agreements of clauses on respect for human rights and the fight against terrorism or non-proliferation. France intends to focus on approaches of this kind. France supports the Barcelona process launched in 1995 and comprising the Member States of the European Union and the States of the Southern and Eastern Mediterranean: Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, Egypt, Israel, the Palestinian Authority, Jordan, Lebanon, Syria and Turkey. Libya has observer status and Mauritania, acandidate for membership, is traditionally invited as a“special guest of the Presidency”. The partnership consists of three “baskets”: political; economic and financial; cultural, social and human. It is the only forum in which, over the past 10 years and more, all the States bordering the Mediterranean have participated. The aim of the partnership is to develop co-operation between the Arab, European, Israeli and Turkish States. The tangible outcomes of this partnership so far are: establishment of afree trade zone in 2010; association agreements; average annual growth of 7.2% in exports from the Mediterranean countries to the EU since 1990, compared to 4.2% for the rest of the world. If it is to face up to the region’s security issues over the next fifteen years, the Euro-Mediterranean relationship must enter anew stage .It will take its place in the projected Union for the Mediterranean, which will go further in political terms. The aim will be to forge genuine partnerships between both shores of the Mediterranean via concrete regional projects, particularly in the economic and environmental spheres, which are afactor of stability. It is very much in the shared interests of the Mediterranean basin countries, and likewise of the European Union countries, to engage in joint and co-ordinated actions in these fields.

The Nordic countries have several matching security policy interests and long experience in close cooperation on a range of issues. Moreover, the dissimilarities in terms of membership in the EU and NATO, among the Nordic countries, make the Nordic security dialogue an important gateway for Norway to the EU. 
The Norwegian Armed Forces (hereafter: NAF) have proven their decisive role in providing Norwegian authorities with the necessary instruments to contribute actively to Norwegian, European and international security. The continued modernisation of the NAF, which enjoys broad political support in the Storting, is crucial in order to enable our Armed Forces to remain a key instrument of security policy also in the future. The process of transformation in which the NAF is currently engaged, is challenging, demanding, at times painful and utterly necessary.

The international community has made clear that there is a fundamental contradiction between armed group and militia activities and the building of a democratic state.

Third, the United States will deter and, as necessary, respond to Russian actions that threaten core U.S. interests, including Russian attacks on our infrastructure and our democracy. Fourth, Russia’s conventional military will have been weakened, which will likely increase Moscow’s reliance on nuclear weapons in its military planning. The United States will not allow Russia, or any power, to achieve its objectives through using, or threatening to use, nuclear weapons. America retains an interest in preserving strategic stability and developing a more expansive, transparent, and verifiable arms control infrastructure to succeed New START and in rebuilding European security arrangements which, due to Russia’s actions, have fallen in to disrepair. Finally, the United States will sustain and develop pragmatic modes of interaction to handle issues on which dealing with Russia can be mutually beneficial.

In the agricultural area we are focusing on regulatory barriers that have inhibited the expansion of agriculture trade, particularly in the biotechnology area.

Yet the regime continues to claim that it does not seek to develop nuclear weapons. The Iranian regime’s true intentions are clearly revealed by the regime’s refusal to negotiate in good faith; its refusal to come into compliance with its international obligations by providing the IAEA access to nuclear sites and resolving troubling questions; and the aggressive statements of its President calling for Israel to “be wiped off the face of the earth.”  The United States has joined with our EU partners and Russia to pressure Iran to meet its international obligations and provide objective guarantees that its nuclear program is only for peaceful purposes.  This diplomatic effort must succeed if confrontation is to be avoided.

Canada,2005,NA,EU," new Canada-EU Trade and Investment Enhancement Agreement (TIEA) aim to go beyond traditional market access issues by promoting mutual recognition of national standards, professional qualifications and assessment procedures. By achieving regulatory compatibility, the TIEA will allow Canada to better exploit the European Union’s advanced science and technology base, in turn enabling further Canadian innovation. It will also raise our visibility in the eyes of European investors, who are second only to Americans in their contributions to our economy and our technological base. A similar strategy can be adopted for Japan. Here our goal is a new Canada-Japan economic framework that highlights mutual opportunities for trade and investment, particularly in technology-intensive industries. By deepening our mature economic relationships through these new arrangements, Canada can build on its successful trade negotiations while increasing bilateral investment.

As part of the New Transatlantic Agenda launched in 1995, the United States and the EU agreed to take concrete steps to reduce barriers to trade and investment through creation of an open New Transatlantic Marketplace and through Mutual Recognition Agreements in goods that eliminate redundant testing and certification requirements. Our governments are also cooperating closely with the civil society dialogues established under the New Transatlantic Agenda: the Transatlantic Business Dialogue, Transatlantic Consumer Dialogue, Transatlantic Environment Dialogue, and Transatlantic Labor Dialogue. These people-to-people dialogues create opportunities for increased communication focusing on best practices, and can help their governments identify and reduce barriers to greater transatlantic interaction.

Canada has contributed military personnel to this important mission.

It is the first review of Canada’s defence policy in more than 10 years and it defines a new policy that is firmly grounded in the realities of the post-Cold War, post-September 11th world.

We’re also using our economic heft to drive decarbonization. Our steel agreement with the EU, the first-ever arrangement on steel and aluminum to address both carbon intensity and global overcapacity, is a model for future climate-focused trade mechanisms.

Our goals are to stabilize the region by reducing long-standing Greek-Turkish tensions and pursuing a comprehensive settlement on Cyprus. A democratic, secular, stable and Western-oriented Turkey is critical to these efforts and has supported broader U.S. efforts to enhance stability in Bosnia, the nations of the former Soviet Union and the Middle East, as well as to contain Iran and Iraq. The President’s recent trip to Turkey and Greece highlighted encouraging signs of progress for reconciliation in the region, including talks on the Cyprus dispute that are being held under the auspices of the UN in New York.

We have supported Ukraine with security, humanitarian, and financial assistance. We have joined with allies and partners in Europe and around the globe to impose sanctions and export controls that will degrade Russia’s ability to wage future wars of aggression. We have partnered with the European Commission on an ambitious plan to reduce Europe’s dependence on Russian fossil fuels, strengthen European energy security, and advance shared climate goals. Across these efforts, the EU—an integrated market of over 450 million people—is an indispensable partner, and we support efforts to foster EU unity.

A mechanism for a security dialogue exists with France at the highest executive levels. Mechanisms for defence cooperation also exist with the UK and Italy. Fresh agreements on defence cooperation providing for an enhanced level of cooperation were signed with Italy and Poland in February 2003 during the visits of the Italian Defence Minister and the Polish Prime Minister to India. Defence-related exchanges have also been expanding with other countries in Europe like Germany, the Czech Republic, Ukraine and Belarus. Cooperation with Europe on defence procurement and production could be greater still if it were not for mechanisms that introduce uncertainties in the fulfillment of contracts on extraneous political grounds. The evolving relationship with France shows that there is a good potential for a path-breaking defence-industrial relationship in areas of advanced technologies cutting across the normal pattern of North-South relations as epitomized during the visit of the Prime Minister of France to the Aero India Air Show in Bangalore in February 2003.

This is unlikely to happen; China is now the world’s largest carbon emitter, and its emissions are still rising. Recent assessments indicate that China’s carbon emissions will not peak until 2030-2040, or perhaps 2050. The particular significance of this is that on business-as-usual growth projections, China will by then be emitting almost as much carbon (equivalent) as the USA, India and the EU combined. This is why the world temperature rise is now likely to be at least 4°C.

The UK aims to maintain a capability edge and must maintain adequate interoperability with US equipments, par ticularly command and control systems. To achieve this we invest in research and development to ensure we can remain at the forefront of important defence innovations. As such the UK provides an attractive home market for product development and subsequently a sound platform for expor ts. Our indigenous industr y is broadly-based, covering all environments and including civil-based information and communications technologies (discussed fur ther below). It also includes enabling capabilities that add signi.cantly to e.ectiveness and value, e.g.: propulsion, radars, power generation and management, platform signature management, synthetic environments and training, electronic war fare algorithms, and open architecture systems. Many of these enabling subsystems are promoted and expor ted in their own right and have been selec ted on merit by prime contractors in the USA and elsewhere. 
That realignment is supported by a substantial equipment programme, recon.guring our forces to project power round the world to protect UK interests and strengthen international peace and stability.

Finally, we will strengthen our regional deterrence postures—for example, through phased, adaptive missile defense architectures—in order to make certain that regional adversaries gain no advantages from their acquisition of new, offensive military capabilities.
Finally, our efforts to shape an international order that promotes a just peace must facilitate cooperation capable of addressing the problems of our time. This international order will support our interests, but it is also an end that we seek in its own right. New challenges hold out the prospect of opportunity, but only if the international community breaks down the old habits of suspicion to build upon common interests.

However, major tensions have developed recently in the relations between NATO and Russia and between the EU and Russia. Amidst the deteriorating security environment, NATO has strengthened its deterrence and defence posture and suspended its practical civilian and military cooperation with Russia. At the same time, it has left the channels of political dialogue open, as the Alliance does not seek a conflict and does not intend to pose a threat to Russia. Given the situation, there is a particular need for political dialogue with Russia and for measures that reduce risk and build confidence.

Hungary,2012,ECA,NATO," b) For Hungary’s security, multilateral diplomacy and the strengthening of international organisations, regimes and cooperation frameworks, and active participation in the latter, constitute the most important means to be used to bring about a world free of weapons of mass destruction. At the same time, Hungary shares the view that as long as nuclear weapons exist, NATO must have a credible deterrent capability, based on the combination of conventional and nuclear weapons. 
The comprehensive interpretation of the concept of security makes it indispensable for its political, military, economic, financial, environmental and human dimensions to be managed in a comprehensive manner, by applying a whole of government approach. The implementation of the National Security Strategy is therefore guided by the intention and responsibility to guarantee freedom and security for today’s as well as future generations.

The document created by NATO lists the proliferation of WMDs and ballistic missiles, terrorism, instability and conflict beyond NATO bor­ders, and cyber attacks as examples of major threats, defining three items as the core tasks of NATO: (1) collective defense in accordance with Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty, which forms the basis for NATO, (2) management of developing cri­ses before they escalate into conflicts and to help consolidate stability and reconstruction in post-conflict situations, and (3)  cooperative security including active contribution to arms control, non-proliferation, and disarmament. 
The 20th century was a century of war. The 21st century must not repeat this tragedy. At present, the global situation is at a major turning point, and the security situation is in a state of chaos. Under such circumstances, the need to discuss defense issues in the “public sphere” through the Defense of Ja­pan is perhaps even greater now than when the whitepaper was launched. What defense policies should Japan adopt to protect peace and prosperity in Japan and throughout the world?

In addition, considering the fact that Somalia’s capability to crackdown on piracy is still not sufÿcient, and that the criminal organizations responsible for piracy acts have not been totally destroyed, the situation in the waters off the coast of Somalia and in the Gulf of Aden remains unpredictable. If the international community reduces its counter-piracy efforts, the situation could be easily reversed. Moreover, the Japanese Shipowners’ Association and other entities are still requesting that the SDF continue their counter-piracy operations; in addition, international organizations such as NATO and the EU have decided to continue their operations. Therefore, there is no great change in the situation in which Japan must carry out its counter-piracy operations.

NATO has been promoting the concept of Smart Defence 5 which is identified as an approach to innovative capacity building. This is the concept with the objective of building greater security with fewer resources through multinational coordination with the following three pillars: 1) selection of prioritized areas to be invested in6, 2) specialization in areas where members have the strength7 and 3) promotion of joint procurement and joint operations of equipment. The NATO Defence Ministers Meeting held in October 2011 approved the promotion of the concept of the Smart Defence and the NATO Defence Ministers Meeting in February 2012 reached an agreement on a way to share the cost for Alliance Ground Surveillance system by unmanned aircraft, which is the major program of this concept8 . The Chicago NATO Summit declared Interim Capability9 for missile defence system 10 that links together missile defence assets such as interceptors and radars from allied members under NATO’s command and control to protect the people and the territory of NATO from ballistic missile attack and also approved a package of more than 20 multinational projects, including joint procurement of remotely-controlled robots which can clear roadside bombs and joint pooling of maritime patrol aircraft. With respect to the promotion of organizational reform, NATO Defence Ministers Meeting in June 2011 approved the reform plan for more deployable and streamlined command configuration and NATO-related organizations, which is currently under implementation11 . The EU tries to enhance its initiatives in security under the strategy of the Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP)12. The first security document adopted in 2003, “A Secure Europe in a Better World,” says that the EU will enhance its capabilities to deal with new threats, will make a contribution to stability and good governance in its immediate neighborhood, and will play a leading role in building an international order based on effective multilateralism by working with the United States and other partner countries as well as international organizations including the United Nations. Furthermore, unlike NATO, the EU does not assume the mission of defending its member states; however, it has been strengthening cooperation with NATO and working on the development of a necessary system in order to conduct military activities of its own, such as peacekeeping, in cases where NATO does not intervene. In January 2007, the EU prepared a posture to have two battle groups13 in a permanent state of readiness and established its own operations center in Brussels. In 2009, the EU demonstrated a policy of improving effectiveness and flexibility for the operation of the battle group which had been limited to use only in emergency operations. Under High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy14, established in 2009, and the European External Action Service (EEAS), established in 201015 as a supportive organization of the former, the EU pursues more integrated approaches while keeping consistency among the policies of the EU to produce synergistic effects.

At present, the ARF is different from security organizations such as NATO and the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE); however, the ARF serves as an important venue for both foreign and defense officials to get together in various inter-governmental meetings on security. The Ministry of Defense believes that it is important for the respective defense authorities to promote trust in order for the ARF to develop a sense of community within the Asia-Pacific region, thereby making the framework to stabilize the regional security environment. To this end, the Ministry has been continuing its efforts to deepen mutual understanding within the ARF through regular participation, encouraging ARF members to increase the transparency of their defense policies while explaining Japan’s policies and efforts, and promoting frank discussion among defense officials. In addition, in recent years, non-traditional security areas such as humanitarian assistance and disaster relief, maritime security, and peacekeeping and peacebuilding have been discussed as common regional security challenges. Every year, meetings such as the Senior Officials Meeting (SOM)6 are held, at which lively discussions take place in addition to annual ministerial meeting. Furthermore, in the maritime security field, an Inter-Sessional Meeting on Maritime Security (ISM-MS) has been held annually since March 2009. In 2011, Japan, Indonesia, and New Zealand co-hosted the third meeting in Tokyo. Thus, through these various opportunities, ways of achieving practical cooperation and the establishment of rules have been sought. In such non-traditional security fields, efforts are being made to seek more practical cooperation. For instance, in the field of humanitarian assistance and disaster relief, following the establishment of “the ARF General Guidelines” that serves as guidelines for international cooperation, “the ARF Strategic Guidance for HA/DR” is currently being drafted as guidelines that lay down procedures for more detailed cooperation. In 2009, the first ARF disaster relief field exercise (ARF-VDR) was held in the Philippines, co-hosted by the United States. Japan dispatched GSDF medical, sanitation, and water supply units, one MSDF rescue amphibious aircraft (US-2), and two ASDF transport aircraft (C-130), with about 100 personnel. Japan sent the second-largest number of participants, behind only the Philippines, the host country. Japan co-hosted the second ARF disaster relief field exercise (ARF-DiREx 2011) with Indonesia in March 2011 in Indonesia, but the dispatch of troops scheduled to participate in this exercise was called off, as they were required for disaster relief operations following the Great East Japan Earthquake on March

Recent assessments indicate that China’s carbon emissions will not peak until 2030-2040, or perhaps 2050.

The launch of CBERS 4, on December 7, 2014, was an important milestone in the bilateral program, with the launch of the sixth satellite (CBERS-4A) scheduled for 2018; – Satellite Amazia-1 (AMZ): the satellite, based on the Multimission Platform (PMM) developed by AEB and INPE, should increase the national Earth observation capacity, allowing particularly the improvement of deforestation alert data in the Amazon, by maximizing the acquisition of useful images in view of the cloud cover in the region. Due to its national coverage, Amazia-1 will also provide frequent images of Brazilian agricultural areas; – Brazilian Satellite Launch Vehicle (VLS-1): project for a Brazilian vehicle, under development by the Institute of Aeronautics and Space (IAE), of the Brazilian Air Force; capable of delivering, from Alcântara, in an equatorial circular orbit with low eccentricity, a 200 kg satellite at 750 km. The VLS-1 has seven major subsystems: 1st Stage, 2nd Stage, 3rd Stage, 4th Stage, Ejectable Hood, Electrical Networks and Pyrotechnic Networks. The VLS-1's four propulsion stages use solid fuel.

This might have apparently deepened a policy of giving priority to the informatization of military forces based on a military strategy to win informatized local wars in response to the global trend of military development. Such military buildup in China apparently indicates that China has given top priority to dealing with a Taiwan contingency by improving its capabilities to deter or deny Taiwan’s independence and foreign military support for the Taiwanese independence, and has recently considered the improvement of operational capabilities in more distant waters to protect its expanding overseas interests.

In the Baltic Sea region, NATO members, NATO candidates, militarily non-aligned countries as well as the Russian Federation all co-operate in security matters. Other, more distant states that are nevertheless interested in the security of the Baltic Sea area also participate in regional security and defence efforts. Among the expressions of evolving co-operation in regional defence, the projects involving the three Baltic states, often with the support of many foreign countries, stand out. Defence co-operation among various states increases security and stability in the region.

The EU, India, Japan and Brazil are also powers of considerable significance, as is an authoritarian Russia which, thanks to structurally high raw material prices, is wealthy and autonomous. Russia will not tolerate ‘interference’ in the Arctic Ocean, where important new shipping routes and areas for extraction of raw materials have developed as a consequence of global warming. In this area of the world, Russian interests therefore mainly clash with Canadian, American and European interests. India and China dispute each other ’s territorial claims and spheres of influence around the Indian Ocean and on the Eurasian mainland, where the most important sea lanes in the world for energy, food supply and international trade are situated. Many smaller nations endeavour to strengthen their positions by establishing ties with a great power or by aligning with the power blocs.

USA,2022,NA,RUSSIA," Corruption poses a fundamental threat to the rule of law. When government officials abuse public power for private gain, it degrades the business environment, subverts economic opportunity, and exacerbates inequality. Corruption also contributes to reduced public trust in state institutions, which in turn can add to the appeal of illiberal actors who exploit popular grievances for political advantage. In today’s globalized world, international financial systems are used to stash illicit wealth abroad and to send bribes across borders. The United States Strategy on Countering Corruption recognizes the unique threat corruption poses to our national security and places a special emphasis on recognizing the ways in which corrupt actors have used the U.S. financial system and other rule-of-law based systems to launder their ill-gotten gains. In response to Russia’s continued invasion of Ukraine, the United States ramped up its kleptocracy initiatives aimed at recovering corruption proceeds as well as both identifying and repatriating the laundered proceeds of crime. Finally, the United States will elevate and expand the scale of diplomatic engagement and foreign assistance, including by enhancing partner governments’ capacitates to fight corruption in cooperation with U.S. law enforcement authorities and bolstering the prevention and oversight capacities of willing governments.

Turkey,2000,ECA,EU,"After the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from Cyprus, the ""Republic of Cyprus"" was established in 1960 on the basis of a partnership between the Turkish and Greek Cypriot peoples with the 1959 London and Zurich and 1960 Guarantee Agreements. This partnership state, envisaging the political and sovereign equality of the Turkish and Greek Cypriots and the participation of the two peoples in a joint administration with equal rights, has not been long-lived. It was destroyed in 1963 with force by the Greek Cypriots, who were aiming to unite the Island with Greece. The Turkish Cypriot People were expelled from all of the organs of the state, of which they were the joint founders, and the Turks on the Island have been subjected to cruel attacks and massacres for years. With the objective of finding a solution to the problem, international initiatives have been made since 1964 and the UN Peace Forces were deployed on the Island. In 1968 the bilateral negotiation process was started under UN supervision. In 1974, upon the initiative started for annexing Cyprus to Greece, Turkey intervened on the Island by using its right as a guarantor stemming from the founding agreements and thus provided for the continuation of the existence of the Turkish Cypriot People on the Island. The efforts for finding a solution to the Cyprus problem, which have continued for the past 36 years, have not yet brought results. The main reason for this is constituted by the claims of the Greek Cypriots that the ""Republic of Cyprus"", which was destroyed by themselves in 1963, still exists and has the right of sovereignty over all of Cyprus. Whereas, the Turkish Cypriot People, who formed their own self-administration, in time after the exclusion from the state organs in 1963, have preserved their basic rights and status, political equality, self-determination and rights of sovereignty and subsequently, with their sovereign will, established the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus (TRNC) in 1983. The unilateral application, in violation of the established rules of law, of the Southern Cyprus Greek Administration (SCGA) in 1990, under the name of ""Cyprus"", to the European Union, has introduced a new negative dimension to the problem. The decision taken by the EU after this application to start full membership negotiations with the SCGA, has caused the strengthening of the irreconcilable attitude of the Greek Cypriots. Naturally, this situation has made the efforts for a solution even more difficult. At present, the most logical and constructive approach for a permanent and equitable solution of the Cyprus problem is the confederation proposal made by the President of the TRNC on 31 August 1998, since this proposal envisages the unification of the two sides on the Island under a common roof by taking the realities on the Island into consideration, on the basis of sovereign equality and the continuation of the internal and external balances based on the 1959-1960 Agreements.

Resolution No. 94/1998.

The National Security Strategy builds on Resolution No. 2144/2002 (V.6.) of the Government on the National Security Strategy of the Republic of Hungary, while the evaluation of the security environment, the definition of interests and the determination of goals, tasks and means reflect the changes that have taken place since the approval of the latter, with special regard to the integration-related tasks deriving from membership in NATO and the accession to the European Union.",1,,,,It includes a description of cooperative actions with the target country.

EU,2016,ECA,EU," Managing the relationship with Russia represents a key strategic challenge. A consistent and united approach must remain the cornerstone of EU policy towards Russia. Substantial changes in relations between the EU and Russia are premised upon full respect for international law and the principles underpinning the European security order, including the Helsinki Final Act and the Paris Charter. We will not recognise Russia’s illegal annexation of Crimea nor accept the destabilisation of eastern Ukraine. We will strengthen the EU, enhance the resilience of our eastern neighbours, and uphold their right to determine freely their approach towards the EU. At the same time, the EU and Russia are interdependent. We will therefore engage Russia to discuss disagreements and cooperate if and when our interests overlap. 
The EU will foster the resilience of its democracies, and live up to the values that have inspired its creation and development. These include respect for and promotion of human rights, fundamental freedoms and the rule of law. They encompass justice, solidarity, equality, non­discrimination, pluralism, and respect for diversity.

This objective is being promoted within the EU, and through close international cooperation and efficient coordination. At the same time, these actions also build national and European-level competencies. The EU must also continue to develop methods for responding to hostile cyber activities, sanctions included.  Finland emphasises the importance of complying with international law and following responsible governmental conduct in the cyber environment as well. In addition, it must be acknowledged that being excluded from the latest technological development may create security risks.

These issues are attracting much attention from the perspective of security due to the fact that activities in such domains as space and cyberspace, which cannot be fully understood based on a conventional geographical perspective, are becoming a vital foundation for national security and people’s livelihood given the further advancement of military science and rapid development of Information and Communications Technology (ICT) in recent years. In addition, securing the safety of maritime traffic, which has been emphasized as a fundamental means for supporting international trading, has attracted more attention since it has been pointed out that stable utilization of the seas may be obstructed due to such events as frequent acts of piracy in recent years as well as through the holding of discussions related to the freedom of navigation. From this perspective, in recent years, various countries have been implementing concrete initiatives, including the reorganization of governments and related institutions, in order to deal with cyber attacks on a range of information and communication networks, which could have a serious impact on the function of a state and people’s daily lives.

Japan,2012,EAP,EU,"Since the 1970s Iran has been pursuing a nuclear power plant construction project with cooperation from abroad, claiming that its nuclear-related activities would be for peaceful purposes in accordance with the NPT. In 2002, however, Iran’s covert construction of facilities including a large-scale uranium enrichment plant was exposed by a group of dissidents. Subsequent IAEA inspection revealed that Iran, without notifying the IAEA, had been engaged for a long time in uranium enrichment and other activities potentially leading to the development of nuclear weapons. In September 2005, the IAEA Board of Governors recognized Iran’s breach of compliance with the NPT Safeguards Agreement. The international community expressed strong concerns about the lack of concrete proof regarding Iran’s claim that it had no intent to develop nuclear weapons and that all of its nuclear activities were for peaceful purposes, and has demanded that Iran suspend all of its enrichment-related and reprocessing activities through a series of Security Council Resolutions1 and IAEA Board of Governors Resolutions. In September 2009, it became clear that Iran had failed to abide by reporting duties based on the Safeguards Agreement with the IAEA and was constructing a new uranium enrichment plant near Qom in central Iran2. Moreover, in February 2010, Iran began enriching uranium to increase the enrichment level from below 5% to up to 20%, saying that it is to supply fuel to a research reactor for medical isotope production. And in December 2011, Iran started the enrichment process at the above-mentioned new enrichment plant3. The IAEA has expressed concerns that these Iranian nuclear development activities may have military dimensions including those related to the development of a nuclear payload for a missile4, and they point out that they have been unable to obtain confirmation that the objectives are peaceful since Iran has not provided the IAEA with an access to military sites, which could be relevant to experiments using high explosives, and other necessary cooperation to clear up concerns above. To deal with this issue, the United States and the European Union (EU) have taken individual measures to tighten sanctions against Iran. The United States enacted a bill that would prohibit foreign financial institutions, which conduct significant transaction with the Central Bank of Iran or another Iranian financial institution, from opening or maintaining bank accounts in the U.S. 5. The EU decided to ban imports of Iranian crude oil and petroleum products in January 20126. Iran, meanwhile, has intensified diplomatic bargaining7: accepting IAEA inspectors8 and resuming talks with EU3+3 (U.K. France, Germany, U.S. China, and Russia) on its nuclear program9, while alluding to the possibility of closing the Strait of Hormuz 10. The international community, including the U.N. Security Council, continues to pursue peaceful and diplomatic solution to this issue through negotiation. Although there is no significant sign of military escalation in Iran and surrounding region, Iranian Navy conducted military training in the surrounding waters, including the Strait of Hormuz from December 2011 to January 2012, while the U.S has maintained its naval presence in the surrounding waters.

The Defence Commission emphasised in its previous report on security policy that it was crucial that the development of missile defence systems did not lead to any relaxation of existing agreements on arms control. An important development in this area since then has been the establishment by the United States and Russia of a greater consensus in the strategic field. It is positive that the United States and Russia reached agreement in May 2002, after the United States had withdrawn from the ABM treaty, to reduce their strategic nuclear weapons by about two thirds before the end of 2012, to a level of between 1700 and 2200 operationally deployed warheads. In this connection, the United States and Russia broke with the Cold War doctrine of Mutual Assured Destruction (MAD). The Defence Commission notes further that NATO and Russia have initiated cooperation on missile defence within the framework of the NATO-Russia Council, and that NATO has decided to investigate the prerequisites for cooperation on territorial missile defence for the alliance. China’s further reactions to the extension of the US missile defence system remain a cause for concern. Continued developments in this area will also be closely linked to future trends regarding missiles and weapons of mass destruction, both in terms of proliferation and disarmament. 
The security policy situation in Sweden’s immediate vicinity has been radically improved by the invitations to Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania to become members of the EU and NATO.

The enlargement of NATO is also conducive to sustaining a long-term American commitment to northern Europe, which is a key issue for Sweden.

It has expanded the scope of its military exercises, which since 2007 have been taking place in the Baltic Sea, the North Atlantic, the Mediterranean and the Pacific.

Sweden,2003,ECA,US,"In this report the Defence Commission evaluates the course of developments in the area of security policy from 2001 to 2003. The intended principal framework of reference for the accounts and analyses presented is the security policy analysis delivered by the Defence Commission in March 2001 (Cross-border vulnerability – common security, Ds 2001:14), though the ministerial communication issued in August the same year (A new structure for enhanced security – network-centric defence and crisis management, Ds 2001:44) also forms part of the relevant context. The international developments and conclusions for Swedish security policy are described mainly against the backdrop of the EU and NATO enlargements, developments in Russia and the consequences – in a broad sense – of the terrorist attacks in the United States on 11 September 2001. At the time the Defence Commission delivers its report, the security policy agenda will, in all likelihood, be dominated by the issue of Iraq’s compliance with the UN resolutions on the resumed work of the weapons inspectors. The Defence Commission therefore intends to return to this issue in further depth in a future report due in June 2003.

We also need official international financial institutions to be as modern and agile as the global economy they serve. Through the G-20, we will pursue governance reform at the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank. We will also broaden our leadership in other international financial institutions so that the rapidly growing countries of the world see their representation increase and are willing to invest those institutions with the authority they need to promote the stability and growth of global output and trade.

USA,2022,NA,US," This framework has five principles. First, the United States will support and strengthen partnerships with countries that subscribe to the rules-based international order, and we will make sure those countries can defend themselves against foreign threats. Second, the United States will not allow foreign or regional powers to jeopardize freedom of navigation through the Middle East’s waterways, including the Strait of Hormuz and the Bab al Mandab, nor tolerate efforts by any country to dominate another—or the region—through military buildups, incursions, or threats. Third, even as the United States works to deter threats to regional stability, we will work to reduce tensions, de-escalate, and end conflicts wherever possible through diplomacy. Fourth, the United States will promote regional integration by building political, economic, and security connections between and among U.S. partners, including through integrated air and maritime defense structures, while respecting each country’s sovereignty and independent choices. Fifth, the United States will always promote human rights and the values enshrined in the UN Charter. 
To solve the toughest problems the world faces, we need to produce dramatically greater levels of cooperation. The key to doing this is to recognize that the core of our inclusive coalition are those partners who most closely share our interests. America’s treaty alliances with other democratic countries are foundational to our strategy and central to almost everything we do to make the world more peaceful and prosperous. Our NATO and bilateral treaty allies should never doubt our will and capacity to stand with them against aggression and intimidation. As we modernize our military and work to strengthen our democracy at home, we will call on our allies to do the same, including by investing in the type of capabilities and undertaking the planning necessary to bolster deterrence in an increasingly confrontational world.

On all these fronts, America leads from a position of strength. But, this does not mean we can or should attempt to dictate the trajectory of all unfolding events around the world. As powerful as we are and will remain, our resources and influence are not infinite. And in a complex world, many of the security problems we face do not lend themselves to quick and easy fixes. The United States will always defend our interests and uphold our commitments to allies and partners. But, we have to make hard choices among many competing priorities, and we must always resist the over-reach that comes when we make decisions based upon fear. Moreover, we must recognize that a smart national security strategy does not rely solely on military power. Indeed, in the long-term, our efforts to work with other countries to counter the ideology and root causes of violent extremism will be more important than our capacity to remove terrorists from the battlefield.

Preventing conflict and deterring aggression rely in large part on an integrated overseas presence.  Overseas, US forces permanently based in strategically important areas, rotationally deployed forward in support of regional objectives, and temporarily deployed during contingencies convey a credible message that the United States remains committed to preventing conflict.  These forces also clearly demonstrate that the United States will react forcefully should an adversary threaten the United States, its interests, allies and partners.  The United States must remain vigilant in identifying conditions that can lead to conflict in anticipating adversary actions and in reacting more swiftly than in the past.  The Joint Force will deploy forward with a purpose – on the ground, in the air, in space and at sea – and work with other nations to promote security and to deter aggression.

India,2018,SA,US,"The critical role equipment offered by M/s Boeing, USA were not fully meeting the needs of the Indian Navy. Owing to capability limitations of radars installed onboard, the aircraft is not able to achieve the envisaged coverage area requirements. The NSQRs appended to the RFP (December 2005) had envisaged the procurement of torpedoes and ‘X’ Bombs as the ammunition for Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW). The Ministry had already intimated (November 2008) the CCS that the weapon integration of LRMRASW (‘A’) aircraft would, inter alia, include the procurement of ‘XX’ ‘X’ Bombs. However, the contract for procurement of ‘X’ Bombs had not yet been concluded. Reasons for non-procurement of ‘X’ Bombs (September 2017) were yet to be intimated by Indian Navy. Thus, in the absence of ‘X’ Bombs, the ASW capability of the aircraft could only be partially fulfilled. One of the primary roles of ‘A’ aircraft is Anti-Submarine Warfare performed by the acoustic system on board ‘A’ in association with sonobuoys, which not only provides capability to detect and track submarines accurately but also helps in garnering volumes of acoustic data. The procurement (March 2017) of low range sonobuoys (‘P’, ‘Q’ and ‘R’) for meeting the requirement of Indian Navy for three years, instead of one year’s requirement projected by INS ‘L’ coupled with non-procurement of advanced version sonobuoys with longer range, as recommended by INTEG, adversely impacted ASW surveillance capability of the ‘A’ fleet, in view of the range limitations of ‘P’, ‘Q’ sonobuoys.

In this context, countries that are unable to prevent the growth of transnational criminal organizations will have their socio-political-economic  conditions degraded by the spread of violence and corruption promoted by those organizations. States with institutional weakness, especially in sub-Saharan  Africa, will probably be controlled by criminal organizations, due to their high power of corruption and to promote antagonisms and internal violence. Civil wars and UN interventions through stabilization forces are also likely. Due to the determined action of the USA and Europe against terrorism, after the attacks of 9/11/2001, state support and hosting of terrorist organizations became very risky, even if disguised.

A further consequence of the enlargement is that in the near future the EU will find itself sharing new, extensive borders with Russia and other OSS states. With the gradual progress of Turkey towards EU membership, the countries of the Middle East, Caucasus and Central Asia will also, in the longer term, become a region directly bordering the EU.

The internal reform of NATO structures, capabilities, and procedures must be accelerated to ensure that NATO is able to carry out its missions effectively.  The Alliance’s door will also remain open to those countries that aspire for membership and meet NATO standards.

USA,1999,NA,NATO,"NATO military operations against Serbia in the spring of 1999 had three clear goals: the withdrawal of all Serb military, paramilitary, and police forces from Kosovo; the unconditional and safe return of all refugees and displaced persons to Kosovo; and deployment of an international security force, with NATO at its core, to protect all the people of Kosovo -- Serbs, Albanians and others. Those goals were achieved. Now, NATO, the UN and the international community face the challenge of establishing a stable environment that provides for the security and dignity of all people in Kosovo. Much has been achieved to this end. Mine fields are being cleared; homes are being rebuilt; nearly a million Kosovars who returned to the province are receiving food, shelter and medicine; investigations into the fate of the missing are ongoing; and the Kosovar Liberation Army has been demilitarized.

USA,1999,NA,NATO,"The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) has a key role to play in enhancing Europe’s stability. It provides the United States with a venue for developing Europes security architecture in a manner that complements our NATO strategy. In many instances, cooperating through the OSCE to secure peace, deter aggression, and prevent, defuse and manage crises offers a comparative advantage because it is more cost effective than unilateral action. The November 1999 Istanbul OSCE Summit agreed on principles and modalities to further such cooperation in the Charter on European Security. The Charter commits members to, among other things, the establishment of Rapid Expert Assistance and Cooperation Teams to assist in conflict prevention and crisis management. The Charter also recognizes that European security in the twenty-first century increasingly depends on building security within societies as well as security between states. The United States will continue to give strong support to the OSCE as our best choice to engage all the countries of Europe, the Caucasus, and Central Asia in an effort to advance democracy, human rights and the rule of law, and to encourage them to support one another when instability, insecurity and human rights violations threaten peace in the region.

Argentina,2015,LAC,CHINA," There are many variables that account for the current international scenario. Its structural features come from the characteristics adopted by the international system after the end of the Cold War and the irruption of the United States of America, a country that through various devices and resources of hard and soft power has projected itself as a dominant global power. Its ability to project forces and influence on a global scale, thanks to the deployment of hundreds of bases selectively located in various geographical enclaves of strategic interest, is the best example of this. However, in recent decades there has been a slow decline of that power –together with that of the European system– and the emergence of new state actors with the capacity to influence the international agenda. The aspirations of these emerging powers, among which Brazil, China, India and Russia stand out, give a new dynamic to the contemporary international system, which thus exhibits a trend of redistribution of global power.

Traditional allies in Europe and Asia were reassured of America's leadership role. Under the ‘Biden doctrine', the USA aims, within an alliance of global democracies, to counter the systemic challenge from China. The over-hasty withdrawal of the USA from Afghanistan led to the only major foreign- and security-policy crisis of President Biden's first year in office. However, the domestic political damage was limited, as there has long been bipar­tisan support from a large majority in America for an end to the ‘endless wars' in the Middle East.

This example shows that economic pressure will not force North Korea to abandon its weapons of mass destruction programs. On the contrary, the escalating conflict between China and the USA works in North Korea's favour, as sectoral cooperation between China and the USA on this issue will no longer take place. North Korea will have even more potential to stir up trouble in the interest of China in the event of a conflict over Taiwan, but all parties should be clear that the North Korean regime will not allow itself to be instrumentalised for foreign interests.
The global order continues to be shaped by strategic rivalry between the USA and China and signs of an imminent division of the world into two spheres of influence, one American and one Chinese.

China is taking an increasingly assertive political and military stance proportionate to its economic weight, and it is playing an increasingly important role in the international system. China’s military and security policy aspirations must continue to be monitored in the long run. Hungary is interested in the vigorous and pragmatic strengthening of Hungarian–Chinese relations, in particular in the mutually advantageous involvement in the “Modern Silk Road” programme (the Belt and Road Initiative) aimed at tightening trade relations and linking the continents of Europe, Africa and Asia. While capitalising on economic cooperation, we must also take into account the factors resulting from the vulnerability that may stem from investment in critical infrastructure by an emerging China, its appearance as a possible supplier of state-of-the-art info-communications technology, and in general by an increase in its regional influence.

With the death of Stalin and the Korean truce, Communist China may tend more to emphasize its own interests, though limited by its present economic and military dependence on the USSR, and, in the long run, basic differences may strain or break the alliance. At present, however, it appears to be firmly established and adds strategic territory and vast reserves of military manpower to the Soviet bloc.

However, since 2015, China has opted to abstain rather than align with Russia, which is indicative of both a reappraisal by new Chinese leadership under President Xi Jinping of China’s position, as well as positioning China as a bridge in a revived Cold War confrontation between the US and Russia.

The rise in populist right-wing political parties and resistance to migration in Europe and some other parts of the world are some of the recent events affecting global security. As the forces of globalization draw countries even closer on multiple fronts, and as increasing advancement in information and communication technology facilitates the accelerated connectivity of socio-economic and political developments, the potential for instability in the world is likewise being accentuated. The policies of the world’s major economic powers and blocs have been shifting in reaction to their own domestic and international challenges. The on-going US-China trade war, BREXIT, the volatility of international capital markets, among others, continue to adversely affect the commitment to a functional, liberal and global economic order as well as multilateral commitments and support for international developmental issues. The increasing incidence of xenophobia and anti-migrant policies stymies global human capital mobility and development; and increases the likelihood for international friction.

Once the START II Treaty enters into force, the United States and Russia will each be limited to between 3,000-3,500 accountable strategic nuclear warheads. START II also will eliminate destabilizing land-based multiple warhead and heavy missiles.

Russia has invested significantly in its presence in the Arctic over the last decade, modernizing its military infrastructure and increasing the pace of exercises and training operations. Its aggressive behavior has raised geopolitical tensions in the Arctic, creating new risks of unintended conflict and hindering cooperation. The PRC has also sought to increase its influence in the Arctic by rapidly increased its Arctic investments, pursuing new scientific activities, and using these scientific engagements to conduct dual-use research with intelligence or military applications.

USA,2022,NA,RUSSIA,"Of all of the shared problems we face, climate change is the greatest and potentially existential for all nations. Without immediate global action during this crucial decade, global temperatures will cross the critical warming threshold of 1.5 degrees Celsius after which scientists have warned some of the most catastrophic climate impacts will be irreversible. Climate effects and humanitarian emergencies will only worsen in the years ahead—from more powerful wildfires and hurricanes in the United States to flooding in Europe, rising sea levels in Oceania, water scarcity in the Middle East, melting ice in the Arctic, and drought and deadly temperatures in sub-Saharan Africa. Tensions will further intensify as countries compete for resources and energy advantage—increasing humanitarian need, food insecurity and health threats, as well as the potential for instability, conflict, and mass migration. The necessity to protect forests globally, electrify the transportation sector, redirect financial flows and create an energy revolution to head off the climate crisis is reinforced by the geopolitical imperative to reduce our collective dependence on states like Russia that seek to weaponize energy for coercion.

Russia’s further invasion of Ukraine poses a grave threat to this vision, which is why we are determined to support Ukraine in defending its sovereignty and territorial integrity while imposing severe costs on Moscow for its aggression. We have supported Ukraine with security, humanitarian, and financial assistance. We have joined with allies and partners in Europe and around the globe to impose sanctions and export controls that will degrade Russia’s ability to wage future wars of aggression. We have partnered with the European Commission on an ambitious plan to reduce Europe’s dependence on Russian fossil fuels, strengthen European energy security, and advance shared climate goals. Across these efforts, the EU—an integrated market of over 450 million people—is an indispensable partner, and we support efforts to foster EU unity. We also encourage close cooperation on matters of mutual interest between the EU and the United Kingdom. In addition, we underscore our support for the Good Friday Agreement which is the bedrock of peace, stability, and prosperity in Northern Ireland.

Unless we so use it that the Russian people can perceive that our effort is directed against the regime and its power for aggression, and not against their own interests, we will unite the regime and the people in the kind of last ditch fight in which no underlying problems are solved, new ones are created, and where our basic principles are obscured and compromised. If we do not in the application of force demonstrate the nature of our objectives we will, in fact, have compromised from the outset our fundamental purpose. In the words of the Federalist (No. 28) ""The means to be employed must be proportioned to the extent of the mischief."" The mischief may be a global war or it may be a Soviet campaign for limited objectives. In either case we should take no avoidable initiative which would cause it to become a war of annihilation, and if we have the forces to defeat a Soviet drive for limited objectives it may well be to our interest not to let it become a global war. Our aim in applying force must be to compel the acceptance of terms consistent with our objectives, and our capabilities for the application of force should, therefore, within the limits of what we can sustain over the long pull, be congruent to the range of tasks which we may encounter.

First, the United States will continue to support Ukraine in its fight for its freedom, we will help Ukraine recover economically, and we will encourage its regional integration with the European Union. Second, the United States will defend every inch of NATO territory and will continue to build and deepen a coalition with allies and partners to prevent Russia from causing further harm to European security, democracy, and institutions. Third, the United States will deter and, as necessary, respond to Russian actions that threaten core U.S. interests, including Russian attacks on our infrastructure and our democracy. Fourth, Russia’s conventional military will have been weakened, which will likely increase Moscow’s reliance on nuclear weapons in its military planning. The United States will not allow Russia, or any power, to achieve its objectives through using, or threatening to use, nuclear weapons. America retains an interest in preserving strategic stability and developing a more expansive, transparent, and verifiable arms control infrastructure to succeed New START and in rebuilding European security arrangements which, due to Russia’s actions, have fallen in to disrepair.

Their success gave birth to greater arrogance, and they moved to occupy the whole of China as a first step to control Eastern Asia. Japan also launched a massive attack against the United States. In the end, this arrogance led the Japanese to a devastating defeat and destruction in the Second World War. The country was reduced to ashes, and faced a debilitating economic crisis falling for a time under foreign military rule. The Japanese, who are known for choosing to die rather than face personal and national disgrace, committed suicide in great numbers. However, the nation did not choose samurai style suicide to avert the disgrace that was visited upon the country for the second time. Instead Japan preferred to make the necessary adjustments to overcome the shame of its second humiliation.

Jamaica,2013,LAC,EU," One of the main reasons why this approach has never succeeded in eliminating organized crime is that it does not allow for the flexibility and adaptability demonstrated by successful career criminals, many of whom have been adept at identifying and moving into new areas of criminal activity. Traffickers will also switch their suppliers, use different shipping routes, develop new products and expand into new markets; partly in response to market prices, and partly in response to pressure from law enforcement agencies. If one form of crime becomes more lucrative and less risky than another, the criminals will usually adapt and change their tactics accordingly. The Italian Mafia, for example, have defrauded the European Commission for subsidies for wind turbines, the Mexican drug cartels may now make as much money from illegal oil sales as from cocaine, while cybercrime now does more economic harm to the European Union than illegal narcotics. Similarly, some criminal organizations have relocated their criminal enterprises into weaker or more lenient jurisdictions when under pressure. For example, as a result of the strong measures taken by the Government of Colombia, cocaine production in Colombia fell markedly. However, the total production of cocaine in the region did not decline, because production simply relocated from Colombia into Bolivia and Peru xviii, xix.

Furthermore, the distinction between the smuggling of migrants and human trafficking is often very subtle and sometimes they overlap. The migration crisis has resulted in an increase in the number of potential victims of human trafficking. In recent years, the traditional human trafficking flow from Eastern Europe to Western Europe has been replaced by multiple and diverse flows all over the EU. A growing number of vulnerable adults and unaccompanied minors in the EU are likely to be targeted by traffickers who, facilitated by weak governance, work closely with transnational organised criminal groups.

Poland will actively seek to direct the sub-regional multilateral cooperation institutions towards the issues of democratic stability and security in Central and Eastern Europe. At the same time, we will be taking measures against the emergence in our part of Europe of new divides that might come in the wake of the EU and NATO enlargements.  
This is the case, since our security increasingly depends on the outcomes of the globalisation and fragmentation processes as they unfold in the world today. Security challenges firstly associate with the weakening of the regulatory capabilities of states and international organizations, widening polarities of growth and living standards of the rich and poor countries, and the resultant public frustration and discontent. Economic backwardness, poverty, degradation of the natural environment, lethal disease epidemics, uncontrolled migrations and ethnic tensions tend to increasingly erode stability of the international system.

Many of the trends in international relations and military affairs identified in last year's report remain valid. The US retained its position as the pre-eminent world power though the nascent challenge posed by a fast growing and mod­ernizing China was too strong to be ignored. The European Union contin­ued its process of enlargement and consolidation.

Ethiopia,2002,SSA,EU," One main concern regarding our relationship with Europe has to do withour failure to make maximum use of the opportunities that the region offers. Admittedly, we have not done enough in terms of exploring sources of credit and aid to finance our development plans and ensuring that the money thus obtained is properly used. More importantly, there has been some failure to gear our relations with the EU toward expanding trade and investment in the country. The main reason for this is our poor image in Europe. Ethiopia is perceived as a country wracked by protracted war and poverty rather than a potential destination for investment and trade, and the efforts deployed to correct the image have not been adequate. Furthermore there has been little effectively planned work done in terms of creating an environment conducive to attracting investment.

Therefore, if the EU weapons embargo on China was lifted, it is possible that the weapons and military technologies of EU countries would transfer to China, and that said technologies would be utilized as a bargaining chip in gaining the edge in weapons transactions with Russia. It is necessary to pay attention to future discussions made within the EU about the arms embargo on China.

The level of political violence has fallen markedly over the past 20 years, but the gangs have remained and diversified into a broad spectrum of criminal activities, including fraud, extortion and trafficking weapons and narcotics. Technological progress has been an increasingly significant factor, as this has created new opportunities for crime, such as identity theft, various forms of internet fraud and the lottery scam; the latter has allowed criminals in Jamaica to defraud citizens of other countries, sometimes repeatedly. The size of the Lottery scam is difficult to assess, as about 90% of victims do not report their losses, but the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has estimated that lottery scams defraud

Argentina,2015,LAC,US," There are many variables that account for the current international scenario. Its structural features come from the characteristics adopted by the international system after the end of the Cold War and the irruption of the United States of America, a country that through various devices and resources of hard and soft power has projected itself as a dominant global power. Its ability to project forces and influence on a global scale, thanks to the deployment of hundreds of bases selectively located in various geographical enclaves of strategic interest, is the best example of this. However, in recent decades there has been a slow decline of that power –together with that of the European system– and the emergence of new state actors with the capacity to influence the international agenda. The aspirations of these emerging powers, among which Brazil, China, India and Russia stand out, give a new dynamic to the contemporary international system, which thus exhibits a trend of redistribution of global power.

Sweden,2003,ECA,US,"The terrorist attacks in the United States on 11 September 2001 illustrated with terrifying clarity the wider scenario of threats that the Defence Commission has described in general terms in several previous reports. Common values were attacked, in what appeared to be peacetime, by a non-state actor using unconventional methods. The terrorist act on Bali on 12 October 2002, in which at least 190 people, including six Swedes, tragically died, underlined the recognition that this wider scenario of threats transcends national borders. Such attacks – and the risk of terrorists using weapons of mass destruction – demonstrate that the joint efforts to protect democracy and safeguard the openness of our societies, which began in the UN and EU after the terrorist attacks in the United States, continue to be needed. The UN, which took forceful action after 11 September, should play the leading part in the international fight against terrorism. It is of great importance that the work is conducted in accordance with international law, upholding respect for human rights and, in the event of an armed conflict, the laws of war. 
The introductory chapter presents a summary of the Defence Commission’s views on international developments and the conclusions for Sweden’s security policy that the Commission draws from them. In chapter 2 there follows an overview of global trends and tendencies that are relevant to the security policy assessment. Chapter 3 provides a description of security-building endeavours pursued by multinational cooperation in various organisations at global and regional level. Security and defence policy cooperation and events in the immediate vicinity are discussed in chapter 4. The enlargement of the EU and NATO, the development of a common security and defence policy dimension in the EU, and the changes in the tasks assigned to NATO are described in chapter 5. Chapters 6 and 7 give an account of developments in the United States and Russia respectively, taking up the influence of the terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001 on American society and policy, and Russia’s work on the reform of its armed forces, among other issues. A number of questions associated with weapons of mass destruction, arms control and the development of missile defence systems are discussed in chapter 8. Chapter 9 provides a survey of current conflicts and centres of conflict, followed by an examination of international crisis management and conflict prevention efforts in chapter 10. Chapter 11 describes the vulnerability of civil society and the relations of dependence that arise from the use of modern technology and access to a working infrastructure.

States without their own offensive tools are increasingly relying on services offered by hacker groups. Inter-state conflicts are also increasingly being waged in cyberspace. Us­ing such attacks, states can operate below the war threshold and deny involvement, and this is often difficult to disprove.

Terrorist activities are directed at disrupting democratic social and political institutions, and at undermining the trust of societies in their governments. Terrorism has a destabilising effect on international conditions, while activities serving the purpose of organising and supporting acts of terrorism (illegal arms trafficking, money laundering) are undermining the functioning of states and the international system. Acts of terrorism may contribute also to the emergence of other global – political, economic, commercial, migration- and health-related - crises.
Resolution No. 94/1998.

The EU’s term for its overarching political guidance document is «security strategy» (A secure Europe in a better world. European Security Strategy). The latter document includes ESDP (the common European Security and Defence Policy) but has a broader scope in that it also includes foreign policy and the use of economic, diplomatic and other instruments. The same applies to The National Security Strategy of the United States of America, published by the White House. The term «strategic concept», therefore, is most appropriate, as it like NATO’s concept relates to the guidelines for the development and use of military means only.

We must build on our com­parative advantages, which are among our major assets. The ability to command attraction and credibility will be increasingly impor­tant, and it will be determined by the values and policies that each State applies within its borders and abroad. Apart from our geo­graphical situation, which is itself of great geostrategic value, we also have the history of our exemplary transition to democracy, our competence as a ‘reliable mediator’ between cultures and regional blocks –such as the Arab world and Spanish-speaking countries–, EU membership, our bonds with Iberoamerica, good relations with the United States and a .rm commitment to develop­ment cooperation.

The growing emphasis on multinational cooperation to establish new and more modern capabilities is an obvious countermove to such a negative development.

Switzerland,2022,ECA,US,"Although the Biden administration had to concentrate heavily on domestic issues in 2021, it did succeed in distancing itself clearly from President Trump's America First policy in its foreign and security policies. Traditional allies in Europe and Asia were reassured of America's leadership role. Under the ‘Biden doctrine', the USA aims, within an alliance of global democracies, to counter the systemic challenge from China. The over-hasty withdrawal of the USA from Afghanistan led to the only major foreign- and security-policy crisis of President Biden's first year in office. However, the domestic political damage was limited, as there has long been bipar­tisan support from a large majority in America for an end to the ‘endless wars' in the Middle East. Under President Joe Biden, the USA's engagement in the Middle East has been further reduced, although it is still considerable, not least due to the continuing tensions with Iran.

Sweden,2003,ECA,US,"The acts of terrorism on 11 September 2001 palpably changed America’s image of itself as a strong and invulnerable country. This change led to a sharp reorientation of the US foreign and security policy, with an increased focus on the fight against terrorism and terrorism’s links with the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. This priority is likely to inform the US approach to foreign and security policy issues – including future developments in America’s bilateral relations with other countries – for a long time to come. The United States now seems prepared to use its dominant position in world politics more openly to protect its citizens and defend high priority American interests. From Sweden’s point of view, it is important that this attitude does not limit efforts to arrive at common multilateral solutions to questions of foreign and security policy. 
1.1.1 	The situation in our immediate vicinity",,,1,,Includes objective descriptions or factual statements 
USA,2022,NA,US," Across our development work, we will continue to employ best practices that distinguish the United States and our partners from our competitors: transparency and accountability; high environmental, social, labor, and inclusion standards; respect for human rights; and local partnerships supported by foreign assistance and sound, sustainable financing. The international financial institutions, including the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, are also a force multiplier for our values and interests. Stronger, more stable growth abroad means a stronger economy here at home. As other economies prosper, demand for U.S. exports of goods and services increases, creating U.S. jobs. We will work to enhance the responsiveness of these institutions to U.S. priorities, including how to better support developing countries as they weather the pandemic and now the spillovers of the Russian war on Ukraine. 
The second is that while this competition is underway, people all over the world are struggling to cope with the effects of shared challenges that cross borders—whether it is climate change, food insecurity, communicable diseases, terrorism, energy shortages, or inflation. These shared challenges are not marginal issues that are secondary to geopolitics. They are at the very core of national and international security and must be treated as such. By their very nature, these challenges require governments to cooperate if they are to solve them. But we must be clear-eyed that we will have to tackle these challenges within a competitive international environment where heightening geopolitical competition, nationalism and populism render this cooperation even more difficult and will require us to think and act in new ways.

The Department of Defense must respond to these challenges while anticipating and preparing for those of tomorrow. We must balance strategic risk across our responses, making the best use of the tools at hand within the U.S. Government and among our international partners.  To succeed, we must harness and integrate all aspects of national power and work closely with a wide range of allies, friends and partners. We cannot prevail if we act alone.

This threat is of the same character as that described in NSC 20/4 (approved by the President on November 24, 1948) but is more immediate than had previously been estimated. In particular, the United States now faces the contingency that within the next four or five years the Soviet Union will possess the military capability of delivering a surprise atomic attack of such weight that the United States must have substantially increased general air, ground, and sea strength, atomic capabilities, and air and civilian defenses to deter war and to provide reasonable assurance, in the event of war, that it could survive the initial blow and go on to the eventual attainment of its objectives. In return, this contingency requires the intensification of our efforts in the fields of intelligence and research and development.

USA,2006,NA,US," The security environment confronting the United States today is radically different from what we have faced before. Yet the first duty of the United States Government remains what it always has been: to protect the American people and American interests.  It is an enduring American principle that this duty obligates the government to anticipate and counter threats, using all elements of national power, before the threats can do grave damage.  The greater the threat, the greater is the risk of inaction – and the more compelling the case for taking anticipatory action to defend ourselves, even if uncertainty remains as to the time and place of the enemy’s attack.  There are few greater threats than a terrorist attack with WMD.

Exploiting the revolution in military affairs is fundamental if U.S. forces are to retain their dominance in an uncertain world.

A carefully planned and focused modernization program will maintain our technological superiority and replace Cold War-era equipment with new systems and platforms capable of supporting the full spectrum of military operations. 
More than 150 countries have signed the Treaty so far, agreeing to refrain from all nuclear explosive testing. The CTBT will constrain nuclear weapons development and will also help prevent nuclear weapons technologies from spreading to other countries. The United States ended nuclear testing seven years ago; the CTBT requires other countries to refrain from testing, too. We have developed means of making sure our nuclear weapons work through non-nuclear tests and computer simulations, rather than by tests with nuclear explosions, and we spend $4.5 billion a year to ensure that our nuclear weapons remain safe and reliable.",,,1,,

The Soviet Union actually possesses armed forces far in excess of those necessary to defend its national territory. These armed forces are probably not yet considered by the Soviet Union to be sufficient to initiate a war which would involve the United States. This excessive strength, coupled now with an atomic capability, provides the Soviet Union with great coercive power for use in time of peace in furtherance of its objectives and serves as a deterrent to the victims of its aggression from taking any action in opposition to its tactics which would risk war.

The Government believes, however, that a greater emphasis must be placed on the defence of Canada and North America than in the past. This must be the Canadian Forces’ first priority. Current threats demand that we pay increased attention to the safety and security of our citizens at home, the most fundamental responsibility of any government.

However, as this process intensifies, some com­mon responses have emerged. Examples are the tendency to favor a greater international cooper­ation, especially within the scope of the United Nations and regional organizations. If this trend is adequately supported by countries it can con­tribute to international security, even in cases where disparities observed in the capacities of states interested in cooperation make it difficult. International agencies for cooperation are be­coming more and more effective instruments for addressing international conflict between states (the ‘traditional agenda’). There are many exam­ples of this trend, particularly the strategic agree­ments between Russia, the United States and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).9

Hungary,2004,ECA,NATO,"The range of security risks has increased in parallel with the broader definition of security. In addition to the traditional nation-state actors, the so-called non-state actors (international organisations, transnational companies, non-governmental organisations, as well as international criminal and terrorist groups) are playing an ever-increasing role in security policy. A particular feature of the international system in the process of restructuring is the simultaneous presence of traditional security risks and of new threats that are often taking a global shape and scope. The new types of challenges and threats are more multi-fold, less visible and less predictable. A typical tendency has been the blurring of the borderline between external and internal risk factors. Risk factors are manifesting themselves on global, as well as on regional and internal level, usually not separately but simultaneously, mutually reinforcing each other. The new challenges can be responded to most effectively through co-operation in the framework of international organisations and institutions and other forms of co-operation. Hungary’s membership in the European Union and NATO entails both obligations to adapt and adjust itself and the

The National Security Strategy builds on Resolution No. 2144/2002 (V.6.) of the Government on the National Security Strategy of the Republic of Hungary, while the evaluation of the security environment, the definition of interests and the determination of goals, tasks and means reflect the changes that have taken place since the approval of the latter, with special regard to the integration-related tasks deriving from membership in NATO and the accession to the European Union.",1,,,,Includes a description of cooperative actions

And they are best served in an international system based on rules and on multilateralism. This is no time for global policemen and lone warriors. Our foreign and security policy has to handle global pressures and local dynamics, it has to cope with super-powers as well as with increasingly fractured identities. Our Union will work to strengthen our partners: We will keep deepening the transatlantic bond and our partnership with NATO, while we will also connect to new players and explore new formats. We will invest in regional orders, and in cooperation among and within regions. And we will promote reformed global governance, one that can meet the challenges of this 21st century. We will engage in a practical and principled way, sharing global responsibilities with our partners and contributing to their strengths.

The success of conflict-management in the Euro-Atlantic region and its vicinity may be significantly increased, if NATO and the European Union deepen the strategic partnership between the two organisations in the fields of crisis management and development of capabilities. There is a need for the co-ordinated application of military and non-military means available to the two organisations in the process of planning and implementing crisis-management and peacekeeping operations.

It has also established partnerships with other key European states, including Russia, Ukraine, and others, further extending NATO's historic transformation.  The internal reform of NATO structures, capabilities, and procedures must be accelerated to ensure that NATO is able to carry out its missions effectively.  The Alliance’s door will also remain open to those countries that aspire for membership and meet NATO standards.  Further, NATO must deepen working relationships between and across institutions, as it is doing with the EU, and as it also could do with new institutions.  Such relationships offer opportunities for enhancing the distinctive strengths and missions of each organization.

Despite disagreements over NATO enlargement and the Kosovo conflict, Russian troops serve shoulder-to­shoulder with U.S. and NATO forces in Kosovo and Bosnia. The United States remains committed to further development of the NATO-Russia relationship and the NATO-Ukraine distinctive partnership.

The economic and military recovery by our NATO allies from their low point of a few years ago, and the revival of Germany and Japan, has given them a greater sense of independence from U.S. guidance and direction. Specific sources of irritation are trade with the Soviet bloc, the level of the defense effort, use of bases and other facilities, and the prospect of discontinuance of U.S. economic aid without a corresponding change in U.S. trade policies.

USA,2022,NA,NATO," Alongside our allies and partners, America is helping to make Russia’s war on Ukraine a strategic failure. Across Europe, NATO and the European Union are united in standing up to Russia and defending shared values. We are constraining Russia’s strategic economic sectors, including defense and aerospace, and we will continue to counter Russia’s attempts to weaken and destabilize sovereign nations and undermine multilateral institutions. Together with our NATO Allies, we are strengthening our defense and deterrence, particularly on the eastern flank of the Alliance. Welcoming Finland and Sweden to NATO will further improve our security and capabilities. And we are renewing our focus on bolstering our collective resilience against shared threats from Russia, including asymmetric threats. More broadly, Putin’s war has profoundly diminished Russia’s status vis-a-vis China and other Asian powers such as India and Japan. Moscow’s soft power and diplomatic influence have waned, while its efforts to weaponize energy have backfired. The historic global response to Russia’s war against Ukraine sends a resounding message that countries cannot enjoy the benefits of global integration while trampling on the core tenets of the UN Charter.

We are working to promote increased security cooperation among NATO Allies and Partners in the region through the Southeast Europe Defense Ministerial process and NATO’s Southeast Europe Initiative. We are also working with the region, the EU and others to strengthen overall democratization, economic development and security through the Stability Pact for Southeastern Europe, initiated by the EU and launched by President Clinton and other leaders at Sarajevo in July 1999.

The clear dangers of the past made the need for national security commitments and expenditures obvious to the American people.

The new Strategic Concept adopted in 2010 states, that the door to NATO membership is fully open to all European nations, which share its value22. It has also deployed the Partnership for Peace (PfP)23 targeted for improved trust and interoperability with non -NATO states and the Mediterranean Dialogue (MD)24 oriented for the stability in the Mediterranean area. The organization has gone beyond these existing initiatives and started to enhance its partnership with nations inside and outside its area and with international organizations including the U.N. and the EU by establishing collaborative relations similar to those established with the so-called Partners across the Globe25 , which include Australia, Japan, and the ROK. Since the 9/11 terrorist attacks, NATO and Russia have sought to improve relations, and established the NATO–Russia Council (NRC)26 in 2002 in light of the need to deal with common issues concerning security. NATO and Russia have continued to pursue dialogue and cooperation in areas such as anti-terrorism efforts, arms control, and theater missile defense27 . The number of EU member countries in Central and Eastern Europe has also been expanding, with the accession of 10 countries in 2004, including Poland and the Czech Republic, and the accession of Bulgaria and Romania in January 2007.

Currently, the Concept appears to be under revision, and discussion about the issue of making Concept revisions was held in January 2008 at a congress on national security jointly hosted by the Russian Military Academy and the Russian Ministry of Defense. The discussion compared awareness of the situation from 2000 until present, emphasized opposition to the U.S. and Europe rather than excessive focus on terrorist countermeasures for Russia and other countries, and indicated efforts for sustaining and improving strategic nuclear forces in order to pursue military modernization and ensure deterrence.
